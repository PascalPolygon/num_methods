Can you project on a lower dim vector space
Take a point in 3D and project in 2D?

Why did you pick a1 & a2? Is that enough to define a vector space?

How do eigen vectors/values relate to projection vectors and constants for vector space?

Do matrices w n eigenvenctors also have n col vectors in their basis?
	Since they would have the same rank
	
If 2 matrices have teh same eigen matrix after decomposition, does that mean they are coming from the same vector space?
