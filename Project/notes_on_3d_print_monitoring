The resolution of the printer in an X-Y
plane is a function of distance from apexes, so it changes with distance from the center of the build
platform

A computed camera pose in homogeneous coordinates allows the
computation of a one-to-one relationship between the Euclidean world points ‚Ñùùëõ
recorded in the G-Code or in the STL model and the planar image points captured by the camera by applying
projective transformations (Figure 2)

Observing the printed layer through the camera lens, a slice of the
material is viewed as a set of pixels, or a tuple of numbers, characterizing the local areas of the
layer. Therefore, analyzing a two-dimensional image provides an understanding of the nature of
the texture of the object.

The proposed algorithm (Figure 7) for detecting printing failures assumes the presence of one
camera located at an angle to the working surface of the 3-D printer. An angled camera allows us
to observe both the active printable layer and part of the printing model from the side. Thus, one
source frame can be divided into a virtual top view from above and a pseudo-view from the side.

Such criteria as bed leveling, dimensionality lost, and non-circularity are dependent on a specific
printer model and are manually calibrated by the user at the time of the first run. It is possible to
create calibration tables to determine the correction factors for G-Code trajectories. However, at 
11
this stage, the above parameters are checked only for compliance/non-compliance with the
specified values. In case of non-compliance in bed leveling, dimensionality, and circularity,
printing is suspended. This method does not eliminate these errors during the printing process, but
it saves time and material.
